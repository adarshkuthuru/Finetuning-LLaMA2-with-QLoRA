## Introduction

In this code repository, we provide a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the Llama-2-7b language model using Ludwig. By the end of this example, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the following key aspects:

### Ludwig: An Intuitive Toolkit

Ludwig is an intuitive toolkit designed to simplify the fine-tuning process for open-source Language Model Models (LLMs). With Ludwig, you can efficiently fine-tune models for various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and completion.

### Exploring the Base Model with Prompts

One of the highlights of this example is an exploration of the base model using prompts. We will delve into the intricacies of prompts and prompt templates, revealing new dimensions in LLM interaction. This knowledge will help you harness the full potential of Llama-2-7b for physics and maths tasks.

### Fine-Tuning Large Language Models

Navigating the world of fine-tuning optimizations is crucial for extracting the most performance from a single memory-constrained GPU. In this repository, we will cover techniques such as Low-Ranking Adaption (LoRA) with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), empowering you to maximize the efficiency of your GPU during fine-tuning.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A compatible GPU for fine-tuning (Llama-2-7b is a large model). We used Google Colab with GPU for this purpose. This is free of cost.
- Google Drive Connection needs to be established with Google Colab.
- Need a HuggingFace account and Token key. This too is free of cost.
- Need access to Llama-2 model. You may have to apply for access through Meta's portal --https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/. This too costs no money.

## Getting Started

To get started with fine-tuning Llama-2-7b using Ludwig, please follow these steps:
